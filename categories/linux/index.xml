      <description>I have always been a fan and user of open-source software and enjoy running Linux on my laptop, so I was pretty stoked to learn about and be able to attend All Systems Go!, a conference focused on foundational user-space Linux technologies, this past weekend. It was unlike a lot of conferences that I have attended in the past and a lot of the topics were over my head, but I met a lot of nice people and learned about a lot of things that I could dive deeper into afterwards and I really enjoyed the small community atmosphere.</description>
