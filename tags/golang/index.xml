      <description>I have many different interests, including baking, open-source software, and more recently, systems monitoring and learning Go. As a way for me to expand my practical knowledge on each item, I devised a fun little project that leverages sensors, Raspberry Pis, and Prometheus to improve my sourdough breadmaking process. I will explain the inspiration behind it, go through the steps I took to set up the project, and detail what I learned.</description>

      <description>I thought it would be fun to also start my own blog to document things that I have learned and am curious about and to recap the many conferences that I attend&amp;hellip;and possibly other random things! So I decided to create a static blog with Hugo, the open-source static site generator and my experience with it has been very smooth and painless. It is very quick to set up and there are many pre-made themes to choose from.</description>
