      <description>I have many different interests, including baking, open-source software, and more recently, systems monitoring and learning Go. As a way for me to expand my practical knowledge on each item, I devised a fun little project that leverages sensors, Raspberry Pis, and Prometheus to improve my sourdough breadmaking process. I will explain the inspiration behind it, go through the steps I took to set up the project, and detail what I learned.</description>
