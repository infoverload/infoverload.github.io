      <description>Chances are that you&amp;rsquo;ve probably used ping for troubleshooting purposes to test whether a host is available or you might have told someone that you&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;ldquo;ping them later&amp;rdquo; since the word has also seeped into common-ish lexicon. But what exactly is ping? Personally I have used it but not given it much thought so I wanted to dive a little deeper on how it works. Here are my findings!</description>
