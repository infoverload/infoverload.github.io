      <description>I attended a Zine &amp;amp; Sketchnote Co-Learning Meetup recently and will be attending PromCon, and so I thought it would be apt to create a zine for the conference.
I decided to make one on the basics of PromQL, the functional expression query language that comes with Prometheus.
Here is my first ever zine:

      <description>I had the good fortune of attending RustFest recently and, thus, it would be very apt to talk about the Rust programming language. I had heard about Rust around a year ago but never looked too deeply into it because it seemed relatively obscure at the time. The Rust conference and workshop has introduced me to the idioms and intricacies of Rust and now my interest has been piqued! I will outline a couple of things about the language and its ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Chances are that you&amp;rsquo;ve probably used ping for troubleshooting purposes to test whether a host is available or you might have told someone that you&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;ldquo;ping them later&amp;rdquo; since the word has also seeped into common-ish lexicon. But what exactly is ping? Personally I have used it but not given it much thought so I wanted to dive a little deeper on how it works. Here are my findings!</description>

      <description>I thought it would be fun to also start my own blog to document things that I have learned and am curious about and to recap the many conferences that I attend&amp;hellip;and possibly other random things! So I decided to create a static blog with Hugo, the open-source static site generator and my experience with it has been very smooth and painless. It is very quick to set up and there are many pre-made themes to choose from.</description>
