      <description>I have many different interests, including baking, open-source software, and more recently, systems monitoring and learning Go. As a way for me to expand my practical knowledge on each item, I devised a fun little project that leverages sensors, Raspberry Pis, and Prometheus to improve my sourdough breadmaking process. I will explain the inspiration behind it, go through the steps I took to set up the project, and detail what I learned.</description>

      <description>I have always been a fan and user of open-source software and enjoy running Linux on my laptop, so I was pretty stoked to learn about and be able to attend All Systems Go!, a conference focused on foundational user-space Linux technologies, this past weekend. It was unlike a lot of conferences that I have attended in the past and a lot of the topics were over my head, but I met a lot of nice people and learned about a lot of things that I could dive deeper into afterwards and I really enjoyed the small community atmosphere.</description>

      <description>I attended a Zine &amp;amp; Sketchnote Co-Learning Meetup recently and will be attending PromCon, and so I thought it would be apt to create a zine for the conference.
I decided to make one on the basics of PromQL, the functional expression query language that comes with Prometheus.
Here is my first ever zine:

      <description>I had the good fortune of attending RustFest recently and, thus, it would be very apt to talk about the Rust programming language. I had heard about Rust around a year ago but never looked too deeply into it because it seemed relatively obscure at the time. The Rust conference and workshop has introduced me to the idioms and intricacies of Rust and now my interest has been piqued! I will outline a couple of things about the language and its ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Exploring Docker Logs</title>

      <description>The mechanics of Docker logs are, by nature, quite different from VM logs and managing Docker logs can be complicated due to its dynamic and ephemeral nature. In the Docker universe, there are different types of logs to be mindful of: logs from the containerized applications and logs from the Docker daemon. In order to gain insight into the health of your containers, you need to understand the structure of Docker logs and what it tells you.</description>

      <description>In this post, we are going to explore Docker&amp;rsquo;s API and see what we can do with it!
Docker has become a popular solution for containerization needs and provide a lot of functionality surrounding run-of-the-mill tasks such as building images, running containers, and managing Docker on your machine. These are commonly done through Dockerâ€™s command line interface, which is actually a client that consumes a remote REST API provided by the Docker daemon.</description>

      <title>How does ping work?</title>

      <description>Chances are that you&amp;rsquo;ve probably used ping for troubleshooting purposes to test whether a host is available or you might have told someone that you&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;ldquo;ping them later&amp;rdquo; since the word has also seeped into common-ish lexicon. But what exactly is ping? Personally I have used it but not given it much thought so I wanted to dive a little deeper on how it works. Here are my findings!</description>

      <title>Starting a blog using Hugo</title>

      <description>I thought it would be fun to also start my own blog to document things that I have learned and am curious about and to recap the many conferences that I attend&amp;hellip;and possibly other random things! So I decided to create a static blog with Hugo, the open-source static site generator and my experience with it has been very smooth and painless. It is very quick to set up and there are many pre-made themes to choose from.</description>
